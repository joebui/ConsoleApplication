I use the "Factory" pattern for my program. Because this program requires two objects, which are inventory item and cart item and
they are common properties such as the record number, item name, quantity and price. Also the two objects share the function to print 
the details of the object. Therefore, I created an abstract class and the InventoryItem and CartItem will inherit its properties and functions.
